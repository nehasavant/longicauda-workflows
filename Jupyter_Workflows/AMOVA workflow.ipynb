    "# AMOVA (Hierarchical Fst) for *E. longicauda* SNP dataset\n",
    "### By: Neha Savant\n",
    "\n",
    "AMOVA stands for Analysis of MOlecular VAriance and is a method to detect population differentiation using molecular markers (Excoffier, Smouse & Quattro, 1992). The implementation of AMOVA in poppr requires two very basic components: (1) A distance matrix derived from the coordinates of the samples and (2) a separate table used to partition the data into different stratifications. Later in this tutorial I will be using parts of the tutorial laid out by Justin Bagley on his [website](http://www.justinbagley.org/3007/running-amova-analysis-molecular-variance-biallelic-snp-data-r).

    "## Creating a Distance Matrix\n",
    "A distance matrix is comprised of distance measures for each pair of coordinates in a data set. We will be using Euclidean distance to start, which is just the straightline geographic distance between points. To create a distance matrix in R, I will be using the `dist()` function in the `stats` package. \n",

    "### Designing your distance matrix\n",
    "Genetic data can be collected through many different sampling designs: clustered, scattered, a combination of both. And how you sample can determine how you create your distance matrix. I have a GPS point for every salamander caught, with individuals found within a meter of each other having the same GPS point. I am choosing to use all the GPS points. In the future, to do more population level analyses, I may find the midpoint of all the coordinates for one creek or pond and use those to create my distance matrix. \n",
